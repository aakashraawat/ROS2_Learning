# ROS2 Turtlesim Catch Them All Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the ROS2 Turtlesim Catch Them All project! This repository hosts a comprehensive application developed as a practical introduction to the core concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). Aimed at beginners and those new to ROS2, this project provides an engaging way to learn by doing, utilizing the Turtlesim simulation for a hands-on experience that is both fun and educational.

## Course Overview
This project serves as the capstone of a structured course designed to guide learners from the basics to the ability to create scalable robotics applications using ROS2. The course emphasizes a step-by-step approach, focusing on the practical application and understanding of ROS2's foundational concepts, without requiring prior knowledge of ROS1.
